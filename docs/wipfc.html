<H1 ID="Introduction"> Introduction </H1>
<BR>Documentation for programs in the form of help files can make the user's life much easier.&nbsp; The Open Watcom OS/2
Help Compiler produces such documentation for the OS/2 operating system's Information Presentation Facility (IPF).&nbsp; It
consumes text documents containing special IPF tags, commands, and (optionally) bit-mapped graphics, and outputs help files
in the .inf or .hlp formats.
<BR><BR>The IPF tags are similar to other SGML tags, the most familiar of which is likely HTML.&nbsp; The IPF tags allow you,
the documentation author, to:
<UL>
<LI>Specify the source (highlighted text or regions of an image) and destination of hyper-link jumps
<LI>Set right and left text margins
<LI>Create lists, footnotes, notes, and various other kinds of notices
<LI>Create tables
<LI>Add illustrations in the form of examples, text figures, and bit-mapped graphics
<LI>Change the size, style, and color of displayed text
<LI>Change whether text spacing and new lines in the source are significant or not
<LI>Customize the behavior of windows in the help viewer
<LI>Create communication links to other applications
</UL>
<BR>This document provides a basic description of how tags are used ( <A HREF="#Using_IPF_Tags">Using IPF Tags</A>) as well
as a complete reference for each tag ( <A HREF="#IPF_Tag_Reference">IPF Tag Reference</A>).&nbsp; For more advanced topics,
please refer to IBM's &quot;IPF Programming Guide and Reference&quot; (ipfref.inf) which is available on the internet.
<H1 ID="Using_the_Open_Watcom_OSD2_Help_Compiler"> Using the Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler </H1>
<BR>The Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler is a command line utility.&nbsp; It may be invoked as follows:
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wipfc [options] input.ipf</TT>
<H2 ID="Environment_Variables"> Environment Variables </H2>
<BR>The Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler depends upon several environment variables that must be set correctly before wipfc
is run.
<DL>
<DT>WIPFC
<DD>This must be set to %watcom%\wipfc, which is the location of the files defining the local language encoding.
<DT>IPFCARTWORK
<DD>Must point to your source of bit-mapped graphic images if your source file uses any.
<DT>IPFCIMBED
<DD>Must point to your source of input files if your main source file includes other source files.
<DT>TMP
<DD>Must point to a directory where temporary files that are generated by Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler can be stored.
</DL>
<H2 ID="Command_Line_Flags"> Command Line Flags </H2>
<BR>The behavior of the Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler can be altered using command line options.&nbsp; Each flag begins with
a delimiter.&nbsp; Either '-' or '/' can be used.&nbsp; Each flag is given a longer descriptive name here, but only the first
character after the delimiter is actually significant.&nbsp; Flag names are not case-sensitive.
<H3 ID="Switches"> Switches </H3>
<BR>The switches change the state of the Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler in a yes/no fashion.
<DL>
<DT>Name
<DD>Description
<DT>inf
<DD>Generate an 'inf' file.&nbsp; Otherwise a 'hlp' file is created by default.
<DT>quiet
<DD>Operate quietly, suppressing the usual copyright information display.
<DT>suppress-search
<DD>Suppress the generation of the full-text search table in the output file.&nbsp; This makes the help file smaller, but the
user can't search for individual words.
<DT>xref
<DD>Generate additional output information, including a cross-reference of identifiers.&nbsp; This is saved in a file 'output-name.log'
where 'output-name' is the base name of the help file being created.
</DL>
<H3 ID="Options"> Options </H3>
<BR>The options give additional information to the Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler Each option is immediately followed by the
information to be passed into wipfc.
<H4 ID="localization"> localization </H4>
<BR>Help files can be created for different locales.&nbsp; This is done by using the<B> localization</B> option in the form
of
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -l xx_YY</TT>
<BR><BR>where xx_YY is the name of the locale (for example, en_US).&nbsp; The localization information is store in a text
file (en_US.nls in this case).&nbsp; You can create your own locales from the sample file xx_YY.nls, but you may also need
to create a corresponding entity file containing the definitions of <A HREF="#IPF_Symbols">IPF Symbols</A>.
<H4 ID="outputMname"> output-name </H4>
<BR>You can specify the name of the help file that wipfc generates by using the<B> output-name</B> option.&nbsp; For example,
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -o MyHelp</TT>
<BR><BR>will cause wipfc to generate an output file (either inf or hlp depending on the -inf switch) with a base name of 'MyHelp'
<H4 ID="warningMlevel"> warning-level </H4>
<BR>The Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler generates three different levels of warnings (1, 2, and 3).&nbsp; By default, all levels
of warnings are displayed.&nbsp; You can suppress the display of warnings higher than level<B> n</B> by using the<B> warning-level</B>
option.&nbsp; For example,
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -w1</TT>
<BR><BR>suppresses all warnings higher than level 1.
<H1 ID="Using_IPF_Tags"> Using IPF Tags </H1>
<BR>Source files for the Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler consist of text (words, whitespace, punctuation, and entity references),
markup tags, and commands.&nbsp; Each markup tags is described in detail elsewhere ( <A HREF="#IPF_Tag_Reference">IPF Tag Reference</A>),
as are the commands ( <A HREF="#Using_IPF_Commands">Using IPF Commands</A>).
<BR><BR>Tags come in four flavors:
<OL>
<LI>Tags that appear in the document header and control how the document behaves.
<LI>Tags that establish blocks.&nbsp; These tags can contain other tags as well as text.
<LI>Tags that are in-line and contain text or other in-line tags.
<LI>Formatting tags that can appear anywhere, but are usually in-line.
</OL>
<H2 ID="Text"> Text </H2>
<BR>Text consists of words, whitespace, punctuation, and entity references (symbols).
<H3 ID="Words"> Words </H3>
<BR>Words consist of letters and/or numbers (ABC123 is a single word, for example).&nbsp; Which letters are valid depends
upon the current locale.&nbsp; For the default locale (en_US, code page 850), the upper and lower case ASCII letters are allowed
(A-Z, a-z).&nbsp; Other letters can be included via entity references.
<H3 ID="Whitespace"> Whitespace </H3>
<BR>Whitespace consists of spaces, tabs, and new-line characters.&nbsp; Usually, single whitespace characters are not significant,
but multiple whitespace characters are.&nbsp; Tab characters are not expanded, so count as a single whitespace character.
&nbsp;New-lines are generally ignored.
<BR><BR>Some tags create blocks where some or all forms of whitespace become significant.&nbsp; In these cases, new-line characters
will cause line breaks and the text will be shown as you have formatted it.&nbsp; If the block is monospaced, spaces as well
as new-lines will be significant.
<H3 ID="Punctuation"> Punctuation </H3>
<BR>Punctuation is not part of a word.&nbsp; 'ABC123' is a single word, but 'ABC-123' is actually two words ('ABC' and '123')
and a punctuation ('-').
<BR><BR>Some forms of punctuation are used to delimit tags or entity references.&nbsp; When a colon (':') or ampersand ('&amp;')
begin a word, that word is treated as a tag or entity reference, respectively.&nbsp; Likewise, a period ('.') ends both tags
and entity references.&nbsp; If you need to use such constructs, replace the punctuation character with an entity reference
('&amp;colon.', '&amp;amp.', and '&amp;per.').
<H3 ID="Entity_References_LSymbolsR"> Entity References (Symbols) </H3>
<BR>Entities are symbolic references to single characters.&nbsp; During processing of the source file, valid entity references
are removed and the matching single character is substituted.&nbsp; This allows you to include special characters that are
outside the normal character set (for example, characters with diacriticals) in words.
<BR><BR>Unless the entity reference is a punctuation symbol, a string of ...-word-entity-word-...&nbsp; (in any order) is
considered to be a single word.
<BR><BR>Unrecognized entity references will cause wipfc to generate a warning.&nbsp; Note that all entity references are case
sensitive:&nbsp; &amp;Alpha.&nbsp; and &amp;alpha.&nbsp; are two different things.
<H2 ID="Tag_Syntax"> Tag Syntax </H2>
<BR>All tags begin with a colon (':') and end with a period ('.').&nbsp; In addition, many tags have flags or attribute=value
pairs that appear inside the tag between the tag name and the end-of-tag delimiter ('.').&nbsp; If you forget the end-of-tag
delimiter, the numerous warnings that wipfc generates will be sure to let you know.
<H2 ID="Tag_Attributes"> Tag Attributes </H2>
<BR>A tag may have one or more<B> attributes.</B>&nbsp; An attribute contains additional information that a tag needs.&nbsp;
The attribute has a name, and may also have a value or keyword assigned to it.
<BR><BR>For example, heading tags have a 'res' attribute that specifies a window identifier (a target for hyper-linked jumps).
<BR><BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :h1 res=001.How to make Popcorn</TT>
<BR><BR>In this case, res is assigned the value 001.
<BR><BR>Notice that attributes are part of the tag, and the end-of-tag delimiter always follows the last attribute.
<BR><BR>Many tags have multiple attributes.&nbsp; If you like, you can place them on different lines or all on a single line.
&nbsp;If you place them on different lines, however, the attribute and its assigned value must be on the same line.&nbsp;
Spaces are allowed between the attribute, '=', and the value.&nbsp; If spaces are required within the value, the value must
be enclosed in matching quotation marks ('', or &quot;&quot;, but not '&quot; or &quot;').
<BR><BR>Optional attributes all have default values and do not need to be specified unless you need to change the default.
&nbsp;Other attributes are required, and wipfc will issue a warning if they are not specified.
<BR><BR>Attributes may be specified in any order within a tag.
<BR><BR>Some attributes may not have a value, in which case the presence of the attribute simply acts as a boolean flag.&nbsp;
For those attributes that do have values, values can be numeric, text strings (with spaces, if quoted), or keywords.&nbsp;
For example, the color tag specifies the foreground and/or background color for text.&nbsp; Only certain colors are supported,
and each has a keyword:
<UL>
<LI>default
<LI>blue
<LI>red
<LI>pink
<LI>green
<LI>cyan
<LI>yellow
<LI>neutral
<LI>brown
<LI>darkgray
<LI>darkblue
<LI>darkred
<LI>darkpink
<LI>darkgreen
<LI>darkcyan
<LI>black
<LI>palegray
</UL>
<H2 ID="End_Tags"> End Tags </H2>
<BR>Some tags require matching end tags to form an enclosing block of code.&nbsp; The end tag has the same name as the tag
prefixed with the letter 'e'.&nbsp; For example, if &quot;tag&quot; had an end tag, it would be &quot;etag&quot;.
<H2 ID="Nesting_Tags"> Nesting Tags </H2>
<BR>Most tags can be arbitrarily nested within other tags.&nbsp; However, some tags can<B> only</B> be nested inside other
tags.&nbsp; For example, the list-item tag (li) can only appear between opening and closing list tags.
<BR><BR>In addition, there are a few tags that restrict the kinds of elements that they can contain.&nbsp; If you try to include
a tag where it doesn't belong, wipfc will issue a warning, the tag will be ignored, and the result will not be what you hoped
for!
<H2 ID="Tags_Requiring_Text"> Tags Requiring Text </H2>
<BR>Some tags (for example, heading tags) have text associated with them.&nbsp; This text can appear either immediately after
the end-of-tag delimiter ('.') or on the next line.&nbsp; Note, however, that in this case the end-of-tag delimiter must be
immediately followed by a new-line character.&nbsp; No other form of whitespace is allowed.
<H2 ID="Units_of_Measure"> Units of Measure </H2>
<BR>Several tags have attributes that are measurements of one sort or another (window origin and extent, for example).&nbsp;
Dimensional measurements can be one of three types:<B>&nbsp; absolute, relative,</B> or<B> dynamic.</B>
<BR><BR><B>Absolute</B> measurements consist of a number followed by a letter that indicates the unit of measurement.&nbsp;
The units are:
<UL>
<LI>c:&nbsp; the average character width of the default system font.
<LI>x:&nbsp; pixels.
<LI>p:&nbsp; typographical points (about 1/72 inch).
</UL>
<BR><B>Relative</B> measurements consists of a number followed by the percent sign (%).&nbsp; The values is a percentage of
the parent window width or height.
<BR><BR><B>Dynamic</B> measurements consist of a keyword.&nbsp; The actual value is computed at run-time based on the current
size and position of the parent window.&nbsp; The keywords for x-axis values are:
<UL>
<LI>left:&nbsp; flush left in the parent window
<LI>center:&nbsp; centered in the parent window
<LI>right:&nbsp; flush right in the parent window
</UL>
<BR>The keywords for y-axis values are:
<UL>
<LI>top:&nbsp; at the top of the parent window
<LI>center:&nbsp; centered in the parent window
<LI>bottom:&nbsp; at the bottom of the parent window
</UL>
<BR>Note that the coordinate system for all window measurements has its origin at the lower left corner.&nbsp; Increasingly
positive values represent movement upward and rightward.
<H1 ID="Using_IPF_Commands"> Using IPF Commands </H1>
<BR>In addition to tags, the Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler recognizes 5 commands (or control words) that invoke special processing
procedures.&nbsp; Each command must start with a period ('.') in the first column of a line, followed by the name of the command.
&nbsp;Commands that start anywhere except the first column of a line will be treated as regular text.
<BR><BR>The Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler recognizes these commands:
<DL>
<DT>Command
<DD>Description
<DT>.*
<DD>Begin a comment.
<DT>.br
<DD>Add a line break (start a new line).
<DT>.ce
<DD>Center a single line of text.
<DT>.im filename
<DD>Imbed (include)<B> filename</B> as if it were text in the current file.
<DT>.nameit
<DD>Define a macro for text substitution.
</DL>
<H2 ID="Comment"> Comment </H2>
<BR>Comments are always useful.&nbsp; They allow you to document your documentation!&nbsp; Any text on a line beginning with
the comment command (.*) is passed over without further processing.
<BR><BR>Don't put a comment within a tag, or between a tag and text that must immediately follow it.
<H2 ID="br"> br </H2>
<BR>There are times when you want to interrupt the normal flow of text and begin a new line.&nbsp; The .br command does just
that.&nbsp; It must be the only thing on the line.
<BR>Any text following a .br command on the same line will be ignored.
<H2 ID="ce"> ce </H2>
<BR>The ce command (.ce) centers the line of text that follows it.
<BR>The single line of text may not contain any other tags, but may contain nameit and entity references.
<H2 ID="imbed"> imbed </H2>
<BR>The Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler allows source files to be embedded in other source files.&nbsp; The top-most file is
the master file.&nbsp; The imbed command (.im) is followed by the name of the file to include.&nbsp; This file is then processed
as if it were in-line with the document including it.
<BR><BR>The ability to include other files makes it possible to break large documents into smaller, more manageable logical
chunks.
<DL>
<DT>Note:
<DD>The embedded files cannot contain the userdoc and euserdoc tags (see <A HREF="#userdoc">userdoc</A>).&nbsp; Only the master
document may contain these tags.
</DL>
<BR>The embedded files must be in the current directory or in a directory listed in the IPFCIMBED environment variable (see
<A HREF="#Environment_Variables">Environment Variables</A>).&nbsp; Otherwise, a full path name must be used.
<H2 ID="nameit"> nameit </H2>
<BR>The nameit command creates a text-substitution macro.&nbsp; The nameit command takes two parameters (<B> symbol</B> =name
and<B> text</B> ='string') that can appear in any order.
<BR><BR>The<B> symbol</B> parameter is the name of the macro.&nbsp; Symbol names were limited to 10 characters (0-9A-Za-z)
for the original OS/2 help compiler, but Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler does not have this restriction.&nbsp; Note that the
'&amp;' character is not part of the symbol name, but is used when referencing the symbol.
<BR><BR>The<B> text</B> parameter defines 'string' as the text to be substituted on each occurrence of &amp;name.&nbsp; in
the text.
<BR><BR>A .nameit symbol is used in the same way as an entity reference.
<H1 ID="IPF_Tag_Reference"> IPF Tag Reference </H1>
<BR>This section acts as a reference, describing how wipfc implements each tag.
<H2 ID="Overview"> Overview </H2>
<BR>Tags are the heart of IPF markup and come in four flavors:
<OL>
<LI>Tags that appear in the document header.&nbsp; These tags control how the document behaves.
<LI>Tags that establish blocks.&nbsp; These tags can contain other tags as well as text.&nbsp; List-blocks and tables are
special cases in that they can only contain other tags and cannot directly contain text.
<LI>Tags that are in-line.&nbsp; These tags can contain text or other in-line tags.
<LI>Formatting tags that can appear anywhere, but are usually in-line.
</OL>
<BR>This diagram classifies each tag and shows which tags can contain which other tags.&nbsp; Tags that are marked as containing
'in-line' can also contain formatting and text.

<H1 ID="Error_Messages"> Error Messages </H1>
<BR>The Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler generates four kinds of diagnostic messages:&nbsp; Errors and three levels of warnings.
&nbsp;Despite their name, warnings are really errors and indicate that wipfc has produced a file that is probably not exactly
the way you wanted.
<H2 ID="Errors"> Errors </H2>
<BR>Errors are always fatal and cause Open Watcom OS/2 Help Compiler to stop immediately.
<DL>
<DT>&quot;The length of the file path is too long&quot;
<DD>The maximum length of the file path depends on the operating system.&nbsp; You may need to re-arrange the project's layout
on disk.
<DT>&quot;Cannot open file&quot;
<DD>A source file cannot be opened, usually because it doesn't exist.&nbsp; Check the spelling of the file name.
<DT>&quot;Cannot open image file&quot;
<DD>A image file cannot be opened, usually because it doesn't exist.&nbsp; Check the spelling of the file name.
<DT>&quot;Cannot read from file&quot;
<DD>For some reason, reading the file has failed.
<DT>&quot;Cannot write to file&quot;
<DD>For some reason, writing to the file has failed.&nbsp; The disk might be full.
<DT>&quot;Unexpected end of file&quot;
<DD>The source file has unexpectedly ended.&nbsp; This can occur if you have forgotten the euserdoc tag.
<DT>&quot;Text conversion error&quot;
<DD>wipfc uses wide characters internally.&nbsp; All text is converted from multi-byte characters to wide characters when read,
and back to multi-byte characters when written.&nbsp; If a character cannot be converted successfully, this error is generated.
<DT>&quot;Syntax error&quot;
<DD>A syntax error has occurred.&nbsp; Usually, this is because an end-of-tag delimiter is missing.
<DT>&quot;Invalid country code or codepage&quot;
<DD>The appropriate file of entity references cannot be found or cannot be read.&nbsp; Usually, this is because the WIPFC environment
variable is not setup or is pointing to the wrong place.
<DT>&quot;Invalid language code&quot;
<DD>The appropriate nls file cannot be found or cannot be read.&nbsp; Usually, this is because the WIPFC environment variable
is not setup or is pointing to the wrong place.

<DD>The document cannot have more than 65535 index entries.
<DT>&quot;The document has no visible table of contents entries&quot;
<DD>At least one of the pages must be visible.&nbsp; Don't hide them all.
<DT>&quot;Cannot open nls configuration file&quot;
<DD>A NLS configuration file cannot be opened.&nbsp; Usually, this is because the WIPFC environment variable is not setup or is
pointing to the wrong place.
</DL>
<H2 ID="Level_1_Warnings"> Level 1 Warnings </H2>
<BR>Level 1 warnings are the most serious.&nbsp; Unless they are corrected, your help file is not likely to contain information
presented as you intended.
<DL>

appear to work fine without them as long as they aren't concatenated and don't use global links.
</DL>
<H1 ID="IPF_Symbols"> IPF Symbols </H1>
<BR>Special symbols can be incorporated into OS/2 help file by using entity references in the form of &amp;symbol-name.&nbsp;
Each entity reference begins with the '&amp;' character and ends with the '.' character.&nbsp; New symbols can be created
by using the nameit command (see <A HREF="#nameit">nameit</A>), but each language encoding has a pre-defined set of symbols
associated with it.&nbsp; For the en_US locale (and other locales using the IBM 850 code page), the predefined symbols are
as follows (symbols that cannot appear in this document are left blank):
